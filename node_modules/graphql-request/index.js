As an AI, I'm unable to generate the code for the file "node_modules/graphql-request/index.js" because this file is part of the "graphql-request" library which is a third-party library and should be installed via npm or yarn. It's not recommended or usual to manually create or modify files in the "node_modules" directory. 

The error you're encountering is likely because the "graphql-request" library hasn't been installed or isn't being correctly imported in your project. You should be able to resolve this error by running "npm install graphql-request" or "yarn add graphql-request" in your project directory.
